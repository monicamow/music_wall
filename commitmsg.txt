added functioning sessions

- get/post for login and signup started
- must be logged in to see tracks page
- html <p> to tell user they are logged in
- added logout button
- sign up creates new user
- login searches for @user by username and password and then saves session[:id] = @user.id
- NEED TO FIX: the way the tracks page accesses the current user/session
