(1) fix user login 
    - add authentication
    - add BCrypt gem
      > add User model; user "has_secure_password"
    - fix sessions
(2) assign user_id to tracks
    - each track should show who posted it
    - get rid of author or change it to the artist
    - test a user creating a new song
(3) "What if the user is not logged in?
    - They can still view the wall of songs but for simplicity, 
    - perhaps we don't show them the up-vote button if they're not logged in. 
    - How can this be accomplished?"
(4) fix votes being ordered by count
    - currently using a SQL LEFT JOIN ... see Richard's git comments
(5) fix vote button
    - "Perhaps only show the button for songs you haven't upvoted. 
      > make the button red if you voted on the song already
    - But how will you check if they have done so?"

REVIEWS

- You must be logged in in order to see the review form, otherwise you see a message saying that you must Sign In or Sign Up to review this song.
- Users can only leave one review. The form should not show up if they have left a review already.
- If the current user (logged in) has left a review, they can scroll down to that review and click a delete button to remove it from the list
- Once removed, they can again leave a review (since they can only leave one review for a song)

RATINGS w/ REVIEWS
- As part of the reviews, ask the user for a score out of 5
- Add rating field (integer) to reviews
- It should be a drop-down instead of a text field
- It should be required and also validate that the number is between 1 and 5
- BONUS: Instead of a drop-down, allow the user to select the stars (there are numerous jQuery plugins to help with this)
